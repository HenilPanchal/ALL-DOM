## Introduction

ALL:DOM is a tiny (10 KB) UI library by [Henil Panchal](https://github.com/henilpanchal)  which adds some useful helpers to create DOM elements and keeping them in sync with the data.

Because ALL:DOM is so versatile and **doesn't use virtual dom**, it's actually **faster** and uses **less memory** than almost all virtual dom based libraries, including React .

It's also easy to create **reusable renewable components** with ALL:DOM.

Another great benefit is, that you can use just **pure JavaScript**, so no complicated  languages to learn  with.
